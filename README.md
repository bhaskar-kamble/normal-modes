## Visualizing the normal modes of a spring-mass system

This repo contains the Matlab code for visualizing the normal modes of a spring-mass system. An animation of the normal modes can be created from the output. This animation, and several others, are included in this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9-1UmBAQOg).

## Files

`fivemodes_fixeBC.m` this code plots the five normal modes of a spring-mass system having five masses and fixed boundary conditions. The plots are each stored as a jpg file, which can then be strung together to create an animation.
